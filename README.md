# r-data-cleaning
I used this code to clean the data that I scraped from the SANDAG website. It corrects misspellings of organization names by replacing each name with the most frequently occurring name that is an OSA distance of 2 or less away, which I interpreted to have the correct spelling. This method created some errors, which I fixed in my code.
